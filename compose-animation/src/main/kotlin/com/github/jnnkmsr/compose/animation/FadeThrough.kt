/**
 * Returns the [EnterTransition] of a fade through transition with the given
 * total transition [duration]. The transition is delayed to allow for fade out
 * to complete, such that the duration of the [EnterTransition] is given by
 * `(duration * (1f - crossing))`.
 *
 * @param duration The duration of the entire fade through transition
 *   (milliseconds).
 * @param delay An optional additional delay before starting the transition
 *   (milliseconds).
 * @param crossing The relative crossing point between the fade in and fade out
 *   segments of the transition (`0.3f` by default). This should be a floating
 *   point number between `0f` and `1f`.
 * @param easing The [Easing] applied to the [EnterTransition].
 * @param initialAlpha The starting alpha of the fade transition (`0f` by
 *   default).
 * @param scaleIn If `true`, an additional scaling animation is applied (`false`
 *   by default).
 * @param initialScale The initial scale for the optional scale transition
 *   (`0.92f` by default). Only applied if [scaleIn] is set to `true`.
 * @param transformOrigin The pivot point of the optional scale transition
 *   ([TransformOrigin.Center] by default). Only applied if [scaleIn] is set to
 *   `true`.
