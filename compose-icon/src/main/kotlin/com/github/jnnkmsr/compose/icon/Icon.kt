/**
 * A [Material Design icon](https://m3.material.io/styles/icons/overview)
 * component taking a [StaticVectorIcon] as input.
 *
 * If [icon] is a [StaticVectorIcon], the static vector icon will be displayed
 * using the given [tint]. If no [tint] is specified, the current default value
 * from [LocalContentColor] will be used.
 *
 * If [icon] is an [AnimatedVectorIcon], an animated vector icon will be
 * displayed. The animation state is animated between its initial and final
 * state depending on the given value of [atEnd].
 *
 * @param icon The [StaticVectorIcon] that is displayed.
 * @param contentDescription Text used by accessibility services to describe
 *   what this icon represents. This should always be provided unless this icon
 *   is used for decorative purposes, and does not represent a meaningful action
 *   that a user can take. The text should be localized, such as by using
 *   `stringResource` or similar.
 * @param modifier The [Modifier] to be applied to the icon container.
 * @param atEnd Only used if the [icon] is an [AnimatedVectorIcon], indicating
 *   whether the animated icon is at its end state.
 * @param size The [IconSize] setting the size of the icon. Defaults to the
 *   current value of [LocalIconSize], which is `null` by default, meaning that
 *   the icon will be drawn at its natural size.
 * @param tint Tint to be applied to the [icon]. If [Color.Unspecified] is
 *   provided, then no tint is applied. If [tint] is not specified that the
 *   current [LocalContentColor] will be applied.
